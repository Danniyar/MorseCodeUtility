        This is a web-app that teaches you morse code by going through levels and providing additional elements.
        <h5>Receiving Levels</h5>
        It is recommended to start with the receiving levels in order to get familiar with the symbols.
        First you learn letters by guessing which symbol you hear. Then it goes to numbers and special characters.
        After completing them, you then learn to receive words, and after you get a hang of them, you start to learn to receive sentences.
        If you want to practice specific symbols, you can do so in the custom receiving level.
        <h5>Sending Levels</h5>
        Sending levels have similar structure to the receiving levels, but this time you practice sending the symbols by typing them out.
        <h5>Translator</h5>
        If you want to translate from morse code to text and vice versa, you can use this translator.
        It allows you to type out the message by clicking on the button, or by using a keyboard.
        You are able to adjust the speed, and play the audio.
        <h5>Inspect</h5>
        This page allows you to hear what each symbol sounds like by clicking on them.
        <h5>Settings</h5>
        If you want to adjust anything, you can do it this in this page.
        You are able to change the duration of a dot, the number of lives, review time for sending levels, time pressure for receiving levels and whether to show progress on letters.
        You can reset to the default settings.
